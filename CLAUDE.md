# coree: Memory and Code Intelligence

You are using **coree**, which provides persistent memory and code intelligence across sessions.

The coree MCP server runs via `npx` and provides the tools below. Because Zed's
context server integration does not inject coree output into your context
automatically, you MUST call these tools yourself when you need memory or code
context.

## Every Task: Start Here

Before starting a task, always call `session_context()` to load prior session
context (pending captures, relevant memories), and `search(query)` to find code
and memory results related to the task.

## Core Capabilities

- **Memory Subsystem**: Stores decisions, gotchas, and architectural discoveries.
- **Code Intelligence**: Unified search over source code and git history.

## Primary Tool: `search(query)`

**ALWAYS use `search` as your primary entry point.**

- It performs a hybrid search across both memories and source code.
- Use it before starting a task to see if there is prior context.
- Use it to find symbols or architectural patterns in the codebase.
- Use `get_symbol` for exact symbol lookups instead of reading whole files.

## Memory Hygiene

To keep your memory useful, store findings as they occur:

- **Decisions**: When you make an architectural choice.
- **Gotchas**: When something didn't work as expected or had a non-obvious cause (`importance >= 0.8`).
- **How-it-works**: After exploring a new subsystem.
- **Facts**: Stable information about the project.

Use `store_memories` to save these findings. Store inline as you work - do not defer to the end of the session.
